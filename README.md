# growth
This project explores growth-related metrics using R, with a focus on uncovering patterns, trends, and drivers through exploratory data analysis (EDA). It's part of my ongoing effort to build reusable, modular R-based analytics tools.

# Features
- Modular R scripts for EDA and visualization
- Designed to work with structured business or operational data
- Clean output suitable for presentation or further modeling

# Status
Actively maintained and evolving. Future improvements will include:
- Generalized functions for data wrangling
- Config-driven EDA pipeline
- Optional Shiny interface
